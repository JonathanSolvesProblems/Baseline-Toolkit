## 📦 Packages

### `@baseline-toolkit/core`

Shared analysis engine powering all tools.

**Key Features:**

- CSS and JavaScript AST parsing using CSSTree and Acorn
- Integration with `web-features` and `compute-baseline`
- TypeScript-first with full type definitions
- Configurable analysis rules and feature filtering

### `@baseline-toolkit/cli`

Command-line tool for project analysis and JSON report generation.

```bash
# Build the CLI
pnpm build

# Run CLI from packages/cli folder to analyze your project
node bin/baseline-check.js src/test/ --json
```

# With custom configuration

node bin/baseline-check.js src/test/ --config baseline.config.json --json

# CI/CD integration

node bin/baseline-check.js src/test/ --json --fail-on-risky

@baseline-toolkit/dashboard
Web dashboard for visualizing Baseline JSON reports.

### `@baseline-toolkit/dashboard`

Web dashboard for visualizing Baseline JSON reports.

**Features:**

- Upload JSON reports generated by the CLI
- Interactive charts showing feature distribution
- Per-file analysis with safety scores
- Filterable views for different Baseline statuses
- Export capabilities for reports

**Dashboard URL:** [https://baseline-toolkit-dashboard.vercel.app/](https://baseline-toolkit-dashboard.vercel.app/)

---

### `@baseline-toolkit/extension` (VS Code)

Real-time linting extension (currently in development).

**Planned Features:**

- Live diagnostics with squiggly underlines
- Detailed hover tooltips with browser support info
- Code actions for common fixes and fallbacks

> **Note:** The extension is not yet complete. The CLI is currently the primary method to generate Baseline JSON reports.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and pnpm 8+
- VS Code (for extension development)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd baseline-toolkit
pnpm install

# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Run tests
pnpm test
```

Development

# Start development mode for all packages

pnpm dev

# Run a specific package in dev mode

pnpm -F @baseline-toolkit/dashboard dev

# Test a specific package

pnpm -F @baseline-toolkit/core test

Configuration

Create a baseline.config.json file in your project root:

{
"rules": {
"allowLow": false,
"blockFalse": true
},
"ignore": ["css-container-queries", "idle-detection"]
}
Configuration Options

rules.allowLow: Allow features with "low" Baseline status

rules.blockFalse: Block features with "false" Baseline status

ignore: Array of feature IDs to skip during analysis

This keeps headings, code blocks, and lists consistent with standard README formatting.

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm test --coverage

# Run tests for a specific package
pnpm -F @baseline-toolkit/core test
```

📊 Baseline Integration

Uses official Baseline data via web-features and compute-baseline

Supports Browser Compatibility Data (BCD)

CLI parses project files, extracts features, maps them to Baseline, and generates JSON reports

Dashboard consumes JSON to visualize safety scores and risky features
